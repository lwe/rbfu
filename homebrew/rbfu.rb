    Please add the following line to your favorite shell startup script:

        eval "$(rbfu --init --auto)"

    If you don't want RVM-like automatic version switching on directory
    changes, remove the --auto option:

        eval "$(rbfu --init)"

    ZSH completion has been installed to:
      #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions
